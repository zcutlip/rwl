# Reading Wish List #

Things listed here are technical reading I wish I had time to get to. My goal is to read one item per week, which means there will be an ever growing backlog. As I get things read, I'll graduate them to the "Already Read" list. They are not in any particular order (except maybe the order I found them) or categorized in any way.
